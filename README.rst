Bricklib 2
==========

This repository is currently work in progress.

Bricklib 2 is a new version of Bricklet that is based on the Atmel Software 
Framework (asf). It will be used for Bricklets with a co-processor as well 
as other projects with newer Atmel processors.

Bricks with the sam3s/sam4s processor will continue to use Bricklib 1.
